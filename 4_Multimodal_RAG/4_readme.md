### 🚀 **Project Overview: Multimodal RAG on a Video Course**

This project masterfully demonstrates how to build a Multimodal RAG system from scratch. The goal is to take a video file (`decision-making-course.mp4`), process its audio and visual components, and create a system that can answer questions about its content by retrieving relevant text and images to feed into a generative AI model.

The entire pipeline can be broken down into three main phases:

1.  **Data Preprocessing**: Extracting text (from audio) and images (from video frames).
2.  **Retrieval**: Embedding the multimodal data and finding the most relevant pieces of information based on a user query.
3.  **Generation**: Using a multimodal LLM to synthesize an answer from the retrieved context.

Let's dive into the technical details of each step!

### **Step 1 & 2: Environment Setup & Data Loading ⚙️**

This is the foundational setup phase within a Google Colab environment.

- **Google Drive Integration**: The notebook starts by mounting Google Drive to access the project files. This is standard practice for managing data and notebooks in Colab.
- **File Organization**: The project directory (`/content/drive/MyDrive/ztm/rag_ztm/multimodal_rag/`) contains the source video (`decision-making-course.mp4`) and subdirectories for storing processed data (`audios`, `frames`, `transcripts`).

### **Step 3: Audio Extraction & Compression 🔊**

The first step in processing the video is to isolate the audio track.

- **Audio Extraction**: The powerful command-line tool **`ffmpeg`** is used to extract the audio from the `.mp4` video file and save it as an `.mp3`. The command `subprocess.run(['ffmpeg', '-i', video_path, ...])` automates this process directly from Python.
- **Compression**: The extracted audio is then compressed to a **32k bitrate**. This is a clever optimization to reduce file size, which speeds up subsequent processing steps like transcription, without a significant loss in speech clarity.

### **Step 4: Transcription with OpenAI Whisper ✍️**

With the audio prepared, the next step is to convert speech to text.

- **Whisper Model**: The notebook leverages OpenAI's **Whisper model** (`whisper-1`) for highly accurate audio transcription. This is a cornerstone of the project, as the quality of the transcribed text directly impacts the entire RAG system's performance.
- **API Call**: The `client.audio.transcriptions.create()` method is used to send the compressed audio file to the OpenAI API and receive the full text transcript.
- **Saving the Transcript**: The resulting text is saved to `transcripts/transcript.txt` for persistence and later use.

### **Step 5: Video Frame Extraction 🖼️**

To capture the visual modality, the notebook samples frames from the video.

- **`moviepy` Library**: The `moviepy` library is used to handle video processing. It loads the video file using `VideoFileClip`.
- **Frame Sampling**: Frames are extracted at a fixed `interval` of **10 seconds**. This is a pragmatic approach to capture representative visual moments without creating an overwhelming number of images. Each frame is saved as a `.png` file (e.g., `frame_0000.png`, `frame_0010.png`).

### **Step 6 & 7: Multimodal Embedding with CLIP 🧠**

This is the core of the multimodal alignment. The project uses the **CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training)** model (`openai/clip-vit-base-patch32`) to convert both text and images into a shared embedding space.

- **Text Embedding**:

  - **The Challenge**: The full transcript is too long (9901 tokens) for CLIP's fixed context window (77 tokens).
  - **The Solution**: The text is broken down into **129 smaller chunks**, each with a maximum of 77 tokens. This chunking strategy is a crucial workaround.
  - Each text chunk is then individually embedded using `model.get_text_features`, resulting in a text embedding matrix of shape **`(129, 512)`**.

- **Image Embedding**:
  - Each of the **373 extracted frames** is processed using the CLIP image processor.
  - The processed images are passed through `model.get_image_features` to generate embeddings.
  - This results in an image embedding matrix of shape **`(373, 512)`**.

At this point, both the textual concepts and visual scenes from the video are represented as 512-dimensional vectors in the same semantic space.

### **Step 8: Alignment via Cosine Similarity 📐**

While the notebook calls this step "Contrastive Learning," it's more accurately the _application_ of a model trained with contrastive learning. This step aligns the text and image embeddings.

- **Similarity Matrix**: **Cosine Similarity** is calculated between every text embedding and every image embedding. This produces a similarity matrix of shape **`(129, 373)`**, where each cell `(i, j)` represents how well text chunk `i` matches image `j`.
- **Validation**: The notebook cleverly validates this alignment by picking random text chunks and displaying the top 3 most similar images. The results on page 9 clearly show that the model successfully matches textual concepts (e.g., "cognitive biases," "system 2 thinking") with their corresponding diagrams and illustrations from the video.

### **Step 9: The Retrieval System (RAG) 🔍**

This is where the "Retrieval" in RAG comes to life. The system retrieves relevant context based on a user's question.

1.  **Query Embedding**: The user's query (e.g., `"Which cognitive biases are discussed?"`) is embedded using the same CLIP text encoder.
2.  **Text Retrieval**: The query embedding is compared against all **129 text chunk embeddings** using cosine similarity. The indices of the top 10 most relevant text chunks are retrieved.
3.  **Image Retrieval**: For each of the top 10 text chunks, the system refers back to the main similarity matrix to find the **top 2 most similar images**.
4.  **Context Aggregation**: The retrieved image indices are collected and deduplicated, resulting in a final set of **14 unique images** that are most relevant to the user's query.

### **Step 10: The Generation System (RAG) 📝**

Finally, the retrieved multimodal context is passed to a powerful generative model to synthesize an answer.

- **Context Preparation**:
  - The **10 retrieved text chunks** are joined together to form a coherent text block.
  - The **14 retrieved images** are opened, read as binary files, and encoded into **base64** strings. This is the standard format for passing images to multimodal LLM APIs.
- **Prompt Engineering**: A prompt is constructed for the `gpt-4o-mini` model. It consists of:
  - A **system prompt** instructing the AI to act as an "expert teacher."
  - The **retrieved images**, passed as a list of base64 data URLs.
  - The **retrieved text**, passed as a single text block.
- **Final Generation**: The model receives this rich, multimodal context and generates a comprehensive summary that directly answers the user's query, mentioning concepts like confirmation bias, anchoring bias, and System 1/2 thinking, all of which were present in the retrieved context.

### **💡 Conclusion & Key Takeaways**

This project is an excellent, end-to-end implementation of a Multimodal RAG system.

- **Smart Architecture**: The pipeline logically moves from data extraction and preprocessing to a sophisticated two-step retrieval process (query -> text -> images), and finally to generation.
- **Leveraging SOTA Models**: It effectively uses best-in-class models for each task: **`ffmpeg`** for media processing, **Whisper** for transcription, **CLIP** for multimodal embedding, and **`gpt-4o-mini`** for generation.
- **Practical Problem-Solving**: The notebook addresses real-world challenges, such as handling long text for CLIP by implementing a chunking strategy.
- **Power of Multimodality**: The final answer is richer and more contextually grounded than a text-only RAG system because it synthesizes information from both what was said (transcripts) and what was shown (frames).
